# Lawn Mowing Solver
This repository contains the code for a solver to the lawn mowing problem.
For comparison we have also implemented a well-known approximation algorithm from Arkin, Fekete and Mitchell [1].
The code will be updated with comments in the upcoming weeks.

Note that this code needs additional libraries to work: The commercial CPLEX and Gurobi library.

Our approach makes use of optimal solutions to the Close-Enough TSP.
We modified an existing solver from Couthino et al. [2] that is available on [Github](https://github.com/waltonpcoutinho/BnB_CETSP) so that we can use it in our implementation.
For solving the TSP, our exact solver uses Christofides approximation as a start solution that was adapted from [this](https://github.com/sth144/christofides-algorithm-cpp) repository.
